# Skill NFT Marketplace

## Project Description
The **SkillNFTMarketplace** is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to tokenize, buy, sell, and verify skills as unique NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). By enabling individuals to showcase their skills as NFTs, this marketplace empowers creators and professionals to monetize their talents, while buyers can acquire verified skills for collaboration or representation.

## Project Vision
The SkillNFTMarketplace envisions a world where skills are universally recognized, verified, and traded seamlessly. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to create a transparent and decentralized ecosystem for skill validation and monetization, fostering global trust and collaboration.

## Key Features

### 1. **Create and Tokenize Skills**
Users can create skill NFTs by specifying skill details such as:
- Skill Name
- Skill Level
- Price

Each skill is tokenized as an NFT and is unique to the user.

### 2. **List Skills for Sale**
Skill owners can list their NFTs for sale, setting a price that reflects the value of their expertise.

### 3. **Purchase Skills**
Buyers can browse listed skills, pay the set price, and become the new owners of those skills.

### 4. **Skill Verification**
Platform administrators (owners) can verify skills, adding a layer of credibility and trust for buyers.

### 5. **Decentralized and Secure Transactions**
All transactions are handled via smart contracts, ensuring trust and transparency without intermediaries.

### 6. **Listed Skills Overview**
The platform provides a comprehensive list of all skills currently listed for sale, making it easy for buyers to find what they need.
